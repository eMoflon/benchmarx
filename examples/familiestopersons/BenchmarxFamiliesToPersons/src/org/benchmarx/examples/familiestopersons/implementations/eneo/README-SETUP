1. Follow the instructions on https://github.com/eMoflon/emoflon-neo-updatesite to install eNeo as an Eclipse plugin.
2. Go to 'File/Import...' and choose 'Existing Projects into Workspace'.  Select 'ENeoFamiliesToPersons' (located at benchmarx/examples/familiestopersons/implementationArtefacts/eNeo/) and import the project.
3. Open META-INF/MANIFEST.MF and add 'ENeoFamiliesToPersons' as a dependency.
4. Select 'ENeoFamiliesToPersons.java' in this package, right-click it, and choose 'Build Path/Include'.  Your workspace should compile without errors.
5. Enable eNeo as a bx tool in FamiliesToPersonsTestCase::tools()
6. Finally, setup Neo4j as required for eNeo:  
	- See https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Meta-Modelling-with-eNeo--B9VY0RnWDn5aZd_jmQyn0PzDAg-jKeVQDlC2BAdD0TDQuF0I#:h2=Install-and-setup-Neo4j
	- Please choose 'neo4j' as username and 'test' as password for creating a local database.
	- Please choose 4.4.11 as the version of your local database
7. Ensure that /EneoFamiliesToPersons/src-gen/org/emoflon/neo/api/eneofamiliestopersons/API_Common.java has been regenerated and contains correct paths on your system.
   To make sure everything is generated correctly, add and remove a space in /EneoFamiliesToPersons/src/org/benchmarx/eneo/f2p/FamiliesToPersons.msl to trigger code generation.
   You should only have API_Common.java as a changed file if you git diff (everything else should be exactly the same).
8. If you wish to use Gurobi then install it and switch to Gurobi as supported ILP solver in 'ENEoFamiliesToPersons.java'

Please create an issue on https://github.com/eMoflon/benchmarx if you have problems or questions.
