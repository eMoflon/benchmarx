If you haven’t installed GHC (8.0.1), please visit

 https://www.haskell.org/platform/

You’ll also need the latest development version of BiGUL (1.0.2.3).

Execute the following in the directory with this README file:

 git clone https://bitbucket.org/prl_tokyo/BiGUL.git
 cd BiGUL/Haskell/
 cabal update
 cabal install

Then the command for compiling the file (to be executed in the directory with this README) is just:

 ghc FamiliesToPersons

which should produce an executable named FamiliesToPersons. 
(Put in -O2 as well if it’s too slow.)
